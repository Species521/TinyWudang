The project has been privately created to provide mechanics and features which aren't part of the UE5 topdown template.
The features and how to use them:

Click-To-Walk navigation


Dynamic Camera Pan


Custom Character


Fake Tilt-Shift Camera


All assets used in the project are free to steal. The environment, the buildings, shaders and materials are created by me and are free to steal. 
the foliage is from the Fab project "FantasyAssets Vol3 - Trees and Bushes", which is also free to download.
